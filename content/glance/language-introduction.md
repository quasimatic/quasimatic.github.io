## History

Referencing things can be hard. It can be even harder to reference something that someone else can understand.

## Labels

Using labels, it allows us to have a stable reference to something without having to worry about the implementation details.

A label alone still requires a lot of wiring up to make it valuable. This is where Glance starts to help out. Putting some querying capabilities behind it we can start to create labels that can work with the program.

## Locators

Locators are what give lookup power to the label.

## Scopes

Labels alone isn't enough. More often than not referencing something can have many duplicates. Glance allows for scopes. Scopes are used to narrow down an item and help the reader figure out how to easily get to the thing that's being referenced.

## Options

Options give a Glance reference that extra piece of behavior and information when labels and context isn't enough. Since looking up stuff doesn't require a type to specified options can provide a way to limit or narrow the types to search. It can also limit the index from a set. It can also be used to tell Glance how to look up the label and completely customize the lookup behavior.
